## What it's walking distance?
"Walking distance" is defined as the distance that can be travelled by walking in a reasonable amount of time. 

In this project, we analyse this distance within any neighbourhood from Natal, Brazil. Thus, we are able to evaluate the pedestrian accessibility at the city.
